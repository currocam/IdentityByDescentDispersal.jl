	abstract = {Recently it has become feasible to detect long blocks of nearly identical sequence shared between pairs of genomes. These identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events and, as such, contain ample signal to infer recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of IBD blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. We introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite-likelihood approach to fit these formulas. We then extensively evaluate our theory and inference method on a range of scenarios using simulated data. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match the simulated block-sharing patterns. We then demonstrate that our inference scheme can accurately and robustly infer dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the Population Reference Sample data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of σ≈50−−100 km/gen during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with increasing pairwise sample distance.},

	abstract = {The SLiM software framework for genetically explicit forward simulation has been widely used in population genetics. However, it has been largely restricted to modeling only a single species, which has limited its broader utility in evolutionary biology. Indeed, to our knowledge no general-purpose, flexible modeling framework exists that provides support for simulating multiple species while also providing other key features, such as explicit genetics and continuous space. The lack of such software has limited our ability to model higher biological levels such as communities, ecosystems, coevolutionary and eco-evolutionary processes, and biodiversity, which is crucial for many purposes, from extending our basic understanding of evolutionary ecology to informing conservation and management decisions. We here announce the release of SLiM 4, which fills this important gap by adding support for multiple species, including ecological interactions between species such as predation, parasitism, and mutualism, and illustrate its new features with examples.},

	abstract = {Stochastic simulation is a key tool in population genetics, since the models involved are often analytically intractable and simulation is usually the only way of obtaining ground-truth data to evaluate inferences. Because of this, a large number of specialized simulation programs have been developed, each filling a particular niche, but with largely overlapping functionality and a substantial duplication of effort. Here, we introduce msprime version 1.0, which efficiently implements ancestry and mutation simulations based on the succinct tree sequence data structure and the tskit library. We summarize msprime’s many features, and show that its performance is excellent, often many times faster and more memory efficient than specialized alternatives. These high-performance features have been thoroughly tested and validated, and built using a collaborative, open source development model, which reduces duplication of effort and promotes software quality via community engagement.},

	abstract = {The Matérn covariance function is ubiquitous in the application of Gaussian processes to spatial statistics and beyond. Perhaps the most important reason for this is that the smoothness parameter \$ν\$ gives complete control over the mean-square differentiability of the process, which has significant implications for the behavior of estimated quantities such as interpolants and forecasts. Unfortunately, derivatives of the Matérn covariance function with respect to \$ν\$ require derivatives of the modified second-kind Bessel function \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\_ν\$ with respect to \$ν\$. While closed form expressions of these derivatives do exist, they are prohibitively difficult and expensive to compute. For this reason, many software packages require fixing \$ν\$ as opposed to estimating it, and all existing software packages that attempt to offer the functionality of estimating \$ν\$ use finite difference estimates for \${\textbackslash}partial\_ν{\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\_ν\$. In this work, we introduce a new implementation of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{K\}\_ν\$ that has been designed to provide derivatives via automatic differentiation (AD), and whose resulting derivatives are significantly faster and more accurate than those computed using finite differences. We provide comprehensive testing for both speed and accuracy and show that our AD solution can be used to build accurate Hessian matrices for second-order maximum likelihood estimation in settings where Hessians built with finite difference approximations completely fail.},
