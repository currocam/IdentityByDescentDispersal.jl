In addition to tests that assert the correctness of the implementation, we also include the necessary code to perform continuous-in-space simulations using SLiM and tree-sequence recording. Their goal is to simulate realistic datasets to test the method. It is not, however, to extensively explore the regime where this inference approach works. This code could be adapted by others as part of their research workflow.
